"""HAR-RV feature builder (Corsi 2009).

The Heterogeneous Autoregressive model of Realized Volatility decomposes the
RV process into trailing daily, weekly, and monthly average-RV components. These
same components are the regressors for the HAR-RV baseline and the engineered
features for the XGBoost model.

LAG SAFETY: every component is a trailing average of PAST RV and is then
``.shift()``-lagged so that the feature row at timestamp ``t`` uses only RV
observed at or before ``t`` - never ``t``'s own forward target. A property test
asserts this lag-safety. Importing this module has no side effects.
